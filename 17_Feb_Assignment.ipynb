    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media feeds, sensor data, or log files.

    "Document-based model: MongoDB stores data in a flexible, document-based format that can handle a wide variety of data types and structures. This makes it easy to store and retrieve complex data sets, such as those found in social media feeds, sensor data, or log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema: MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, allowing you to add and modify fields in your documents as your data evolves over time. This makes it easy to adjust your data model as your business requirements change, without the need for complex database migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides a variety of indexing options, including text search and geospatial indexing, which can greatly improve query performance and support complex data queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that you can easily add more nodes to your database cluster as your data needs grow. This allows you to handle large volumes of data and high levels of traffic, making MongoDB a great choice for high-growth applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replica set support, which ensures that your data remains highly available even in the event of a node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that supports advanced data processing and analysis, including grouping, filtering, and transformation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for various programming languages: MongoDB provides support for a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, making it easy to integrate with your existing application stack.\n",
