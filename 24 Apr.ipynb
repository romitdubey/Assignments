    "Ans: The covariance matrix plays a central role in PCA because it contains information about the relationships between the features in the data. Specifically, the covariance matrix measures the degree to which two features co-vary (i.e., vary together) across the data set. By analyzing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, PCA is able to identify the directions of maximum variance in the data and use these directions to construct the new principal components."

    "Ans: The choice of the number of principal components to retain in PCA can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. Retaining too few principal components may result in an underfit model that fails to capture important patterns in the data, while retaining too many principal components may lead to overfitting and loss of interpretability. Generally, the optimal number of principal components is chosen by balancing the amount of variance explained by the components with the desire for a simple and interpretable model.\n",
