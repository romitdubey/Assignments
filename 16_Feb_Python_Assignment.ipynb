    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined relationships between them. The tables are linked through foreign keys, which create relationships between different tables. SQL databases are highly structured and follow a schema that defines the relationships between tables. SQL is a powerful language used to manage and query structured data in these databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use tables or predefined schemas. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, or column-family databases to store and retrieve data. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible, and they are well suited for handling unstructured and semi-structured data."
