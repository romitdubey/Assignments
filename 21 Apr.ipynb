    "Ans: Some potential drawbacks of using KNN as a classifier or regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computationally expensive:** KNN requires computing the distance between each data point and all other data points in the training set, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to feature scaling:** KNN uses the distance metric to determine similarity between data points, and therefore, the performance of the model can be sensitive to feature scaling. If features are not scaled appropriately, features with large magnitudes can dominate the distance metric and affect the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity to the choice of distance metric:** The performance of KNN can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric used to measure similarity between data points. Certain distance metrics may be more appropriate for certain types of data and may need to be chosen carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Curse of dimensionality:** As the dimensionality of the feature space increases, the number of samples required to effectively cover the feature space increases exponentially. This can make it difficult to obtain good performance with KNN for high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these drawbacks, there are several techniques that can be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approximate nearest neighbors:** One way to reduce the computational complexity of KNN is to use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, which provide an approximate solution to the nearest neighbor search problem in a more efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature scaling:** To address sensitivity to feature scaling, we can normalize or standardize the features so that they are on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alternative distance metrics:** There are several alternative distance metrics that can be used instead of Euclidean or Manhattan distance, such as Mahalanobis distance, cosine similarity, or correlation distance. Choosing an appropriate distance metric can improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality reduction:** To address the curse of dimensionality, we can use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space."
