    "Ans: Eigen decomposition is a method for decomposing a square matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This decomposition is significant in linear algebra because it allows us to transform the matrix into a new basis where the principal components can be identified. The principal components are the directions in which the data varies the most, and are represented by the eigenvectors of the matrix. The eigenvalues represent the amount of variation in the data along each principal component. This makes eigen decomposition a useful tool for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and feature extraction. It is also used in many applications in physics, engineering, and computer science."

We can then normalize the eigenvectors to get an orthonormal basis for A, which is given by the matrix Q = [[1/√2, -1/√2], [1/√2, 1/√2]]. We can use this basis to diagonalize A as A = QΛQ^T, where Λ = [[4, 0], [0, 2]]."
